# Z - the Zicht Automation Tool #

## History ##
Development on Z started begin 2012 in PHP. After a few years working on a grammar that was a combination of YML and
a custom expression grammar, the limitations of that language and the seemingly reached ceiling of further development
on the tool, triggered a rewrite in JavaScript.

## Future ##
The general idea is to publish the tool under terms of an MIT-style license.

## What does Z do? ##
Z is an orchestration tool, closely integrated with your shell. This resembles GNU Make the most. The main difference
with other build tools is that Z is focussed on expressive syntax, ease of use and does not hide anything from the user.
Any command (task or otherwise) that has to be done by the tool, is inherently inspectable, which means that it is easy
to debug and adapt to different build systems.

## How to get started? ##
Z will be published to npm as soon as the first version will reach alpha state. Wondering how you can help? Please
